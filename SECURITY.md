# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The DEB8 team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

üìß **security@deb8platform.com**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
3. **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact assessment** of the vulnerability
7. **Potential mitigations** you've identified

### Response Timeline

### Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- We will provide a more detailed response within 7 days
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
- We may ask for additional information or guidance
- Once fixed, we will coordinate public disclosure with you

### Bug Bounty

- Acknowledge your contribution (with your permission)
- List you in our security hall of fame
- Provide swag/merchandise (if available)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique JWT secrets
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use environment-specific configurations

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong MongoDB passwords
   - Enable MongoDB authentication
   - Use connection string encryption
   - Regularly backup your database
   - Use MongoDB Atlas with IP whitelisting

3. **API Security**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Enable CORS only for trusted domains

4. **Server Security**
   - Keep Node.js and npm updated
   - Use process managers (PM2, Forever)
   - Implement proper logging
   - Use firewalls and security groups
   - Regular security audits

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   ```bash
   # Check for vulnerabilities
   npm audit
   
   # Fix vulnerabilities
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Review dependency licenses
   - Avoid deprecated packages
   - Use lock files (package-lock.json)

3. **Authentication**
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing
   - Implement proper session management
   - Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Use secure JWT secrets

4. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement content security policies
   - Validate file uploads
   - Escape output properly

### For Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication (when available)
   - Don't share your credentials
   - Log out after using public computers
   - Regularly review your account activity

2. **Privacy**
   - Be cautious about sharing personal information
   - Review privacy settings regularly
   - Report suspicious activity
   - Use private rooms for sensitive discussions

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

1. **JWT Tokens**
   - Tokens are stored in localStorage
   - Tokens expire after 7 days
   - Tokens include user ID and username only

2. **Password Storage**
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
   - Salt rounds: 10
   - No password recovery via email (yet)

3. **WebSocket Security**
   - Socket connections require JWT authentication
   - CORS is configured for specific origins
   - Connection limits prevent DoS attacks

## Security Headers

We recommend implementing the following security headers in production:

```javascript
// Express middleware for security headers
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
  res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'");
  next();
});
```

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update our dependencies. Current critical dependencies:

- **Express** - Web framework
- **MongoDB/Mongoose** - Database
- **Socket.io** - Real-time communication
- **JWT** - Authentication
- **bcrypt.js** - Password hashing
- **React** - Frontend framework
